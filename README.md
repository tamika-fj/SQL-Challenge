Module 9 SQL Challenge. In this repositry I have uploaded a folder called EmployeeSQL which contains 2 sql files, one called EmployeeSQLSchema that has the table schema for the challange and another called EmployeeSQL data analysis which contains the code for the queries. It also contains a PNG file called employee ERD which contains the entity relationship diagram I created as a precursor to the table schema. There is also a Starter files folder which contains the raw data files. I changed the data type for birth date and hire date in the emploee file so that it could be imported into postgres as a date data type.To create the code I adapted code from class activities and lectures. I used advice from https://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/6-ways-to-fix-dates-formatted-as-text-in-excel to change the date data type in the employee data file.
